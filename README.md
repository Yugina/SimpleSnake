# SimpleSnake
This is just a basic clone of the classic Snake game made with Godot. I made it mostly to see if I could. It was a learning exercise. The code is not pretty, but that's partly intentional... or so I'd like to say. I based it off of Google's rendition of the game: https://www.google.com/fbx?fbx=snake_arcade
